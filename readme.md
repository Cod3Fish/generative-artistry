## Generative Artistry

Generative artistry is a **work in progress** blog & tutorial website exploring generative art with self-coding examples. 

### Tutorial Markdown

The version of tutorial markdown in this demo is super conceptual, and is currently being completely rewritten, so please take it with a gain of salt, and bare with me for a month or so. Or reach out if you want to help!

### Setup
Generative artistry runs on hugo, to set it up locally you will need to:
1. `git clone git@github.com:tholman/generative-artistry.git`
1. `npm install`
1. `hugo server`
